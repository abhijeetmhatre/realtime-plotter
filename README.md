# realtime-plotter
Python data plotter for realtime data
I was developing a plotter for one of my friends from medical devices domain. I thought it would be easy to find one where the plotter could be run in a loop and I did find some code on the net. But it was very basic and had an issue of somewhat of a memory leak. I modified it and added some features to make it usable.  

This can be easily integrated into any existing codebase. There is an infinite loop which fetches and plots values.
Currently it plots cpu usage but can be made to plot any set of values.

Hope you find it useful.
